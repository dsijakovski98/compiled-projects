## Quick introduction

My name is **Даниел Шијаковски** and I am a 4th year student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies - [FEIT](https://feit.ukim.edu.mk/en) . \
I've compiled a list of my favorite projects made using the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) JavaScript libraries.

* ## ReactJS projects
### 1. Melo D - find the lyrics to all your favorite songs
   
 This quick project was a good practice for me to learn the ins and 
 outs of using React Hooks to make API calls in a clean and efficient way.

### 2. Popovi winery - web site for a Macedonian winery
   
 This website is a part of a project involving my college and   
 [Creative Hub](https://www.creativehub.mk/) - Web Design and Development Academy. 5 students (including me) were given a local company to make a web site for.   
This project is a remake of an already existing hosted site [link here](http://www.popoviwine.com/index.html).

### 5. Fireflies - genetic algorithm implementation example

This project is an implementation of a classic genetic algorithm. Particles (fireflies) are trying to reach the goal by learning to move through the space on the screen. You can place obstacles for the fireflies by creating rectangles with click-and-drag
